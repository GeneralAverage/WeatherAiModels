# WeatherAiModels
3 AI weather models for 2025 Delbarton Science fair.\n
Used Scikit-Learn for this stuff.\n
The matplotlib graph does not show on github codespaces for some reason, I don't know how to fix it.\n
Realistically, you could slightly modify the code and import any dataset and it'll work.\n
I hypertuned the parameters, but that only really had lots of effect on the SGD model.\n
I don't know what else to say.
