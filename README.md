# WeatherAiModels
3 AI weather models for 2025 Delbarton Science fair.    

Used Scikit-Learn for this stuff.      

The matplotlib graph does not show on github codespaces for some reason, I don't know how to fix it.   

Realistically, you could slightly modify the code and import any dataset and it'll work.    

I hypertuned the parameters, but that only really had lots of effect on the SGD model.   

I don't know what else to say.
